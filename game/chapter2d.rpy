        but now it seemed like things were finally getting interesting."
    "Emily had teased about taking you somewhere old that was actually very new, and had said it would technically count as a work trip, since she was 
        following up on a lead."
    emily "...but like I said, I'm still glad to spend the time with you. Once we've done our researching, I want to hear all about your dates this week."

    "The Grind House, and to its right the Baxter Family Bakery, brought some delicious smells into the air, but they mingled strangely with the smell of 
        pavement."
    "On the far left was the Law Office of Demarcus Dillon, its gorgeous, unforgettable signage unfortunately out of sight for the time being."

        as she fished for something in her bag."

    "You can hear cars driving past, and even some pulling in to the Pepper's and Pizza Place parking lot, but the buildings in front of you block 
        the line of sight."
    "Across a small alley to the left is the dentist office, and too the far right of all the buildings sat the Bank, perched on the corner of Main and Creek."

        with matching patterns on the ceiling and walls."

    emily "Okay [pc.name], you know the old gossip, right? I'm sure you've read some of my older work on the subject."
    "While a small part of you resents Emily's cocksure attitude and assumption that you, practically an adult, would have read articles written and published 
        by a then-middle schooler, you have in fact read all of Emily's work."
    "What else was there to do in this town, anyway? It was decent investigative journalism, all things considered."
    "You know the facts: the owner of the arcade, Shellie Diedeme, disappeared five years ago after leaving a note saying she was taking \"time off\" to travel 
        after the loss of her brother."
    "In the note, she said he died in a car accident in California, and after the funeral she wouldn't be back for a while. Shellie had not come back, and that 
        left the arcade vacant, with ownership still rightfully belonging to her."
    emily "Well, recently Demarcus Dillon has been asking around in court about squatters rights to this building. It sounds like someone is making a move to 
        claim the place, and I want to know why."
    emily "Getting the code to the place was child's play, and with you here as my extra eyes and ears, I want to see for myself who is squatting in 
        the old arcade."
    "As you have been talking, moving past the bathroom and handful of tables, Emily's flashlight has swept across the room. A long line of pinball machines 
        cover the far left wall, then rows and rows of arcade games fill the middle of the building."

        It looked like it had just been closed for the night, rather than shuttered for five years."
    "The only difference being the concessions stand, as someone had been thoughtful enough to remove anything that could expire. That left the stand just a 
        little over halfway fully stocked, with bags of candy and chips hanging down long clip chains from the ceiling."
    "On the far wall you can see the extensive collection of pinball machines, all ready for the next customer to step up and take their rightful place. 
        Everything looks like it has been cared for, except for the small layer of dust coating everything."

        that it is plain and unadorned."
    emily "Okay, got it! Step back for a second. Oh, and hold this!"
    "Emily hands you the flashlight as she moves toward the keypad."
    "A second later you hear the BEEP of the lock, and a click as Emily swings the door open on silent hinges."
    "You sweep the room with the flashlight, seeing mostly old brown cardboard boxes full of concession stand supplies, a large standing tool box littered 
        with loose machinery, a door in the far right corner of the room, and on the far wall a row of what looks like utility equipment."

    emily "Demarcus must be making some quasi-legal claim to ownership since his law office is attached to the building and he pays for the plumbing still. That bozo can't afford to fix his 1-800-DIWORCE back to \"DIVORCE,\" so I'm sure he's looking for an easy cash grab."
