    "you are finally meeting back up with Emily, and instead of doing work in the newspaper room as you usually do, Emily is surprising you with a 
        secretive story lead, and taking you on a trip to a suprise location."

    "As you shut the door to Emily's car in the familiar parking lot, your pulse finally starts to quicken."
    "You check your watch, noting just 30 more minutes until sunset."
    "The school days and newspaper work had all been relatively dull this week, with the exception of a few new smiles from Emily, 
        but now it seemed like things were finally getting interesting."
    "Emily had teased about taking you somewhere old that was actually very new, and had said it would technically count as a work trip, since she was 
        following up on a lead."
    emily "...but like I said, I'm still glad to spend the time with you. Once we've done our researching, I want to hear all about your dates this week."
    emily "Those weirdos mean so much to me, and I just know you're all going to love each other."
    emily "I'm getting ahead of myself - let's head inside!!"

    "That's when you realize which door Emily is walking to in the small, partially empty parking lot."
    "In front of you are the backs of four buildings, and you knew Main Street was just on the other side of them."
    "The Grind House, and to its right the Baxter Family Bakery, brought some delicious smells into the air, but they mingled strangely with the smell of 
        pavement."
    "On the far left was the Law Office of Demarcus Dillon, its gorgeous, unforgettable signage unfortunately out of sight for the time being."
    "Emily stood at the door to the building between the Law Office and the Grind House, eyes scanning the parking lot subtly but with unmistakable intensity 
        as she fished for something in her bag."

    "Nothing looks out of place in the parking lot, nor in the surrounding small alleys connecting back to Main Street and Creek Drive. The sleepy town is just 
        that, drowsing on the edge of darkness, waiting patiently for the sun to go down."
    "You can hear cars driving past, and even some pulling in to the Pepper's and Pizza Place parking lot, but the buildings in front of you block 
        the line of sight."
    "Across a small alley to the left is the dentist office, and too the far right of all the buildings sat the Bank, perched on the corner of Main and Creek."
    "Beyond that, City Hall sat, cold and altogether lifeless at this time of day. If there was ever an absolutely perfect time to break in to the abandoned 
        arcade, it was right now."

    "There's a smile on Emily's face as she says this, but she can't hide the slight annoyance creeping into her tone. 
        Had she really been expecting more trust from you? Embarrassment rolls over you as you catch up with her."

label ch2d_006:
    "With a final rustle, Emily closes her bag quickly and turns to the door."
    "She enters something into the keypad, and the lock opens with a small BEEP."
    "As she turns the handle and opens the door, she steps to the side with a mischievous grin."
    emily "After you, beautiful!"
    "You are most definitely NOT flustered by this at all, just nervous and excited to see inside the old arcade. 
        That's why your laugh comes out just a bit too loud."

    "As the door swings shut behind you, your eyes struggle for a moment to adjust to the dark room."
    "For one moment, you're standing in a galaxy of green, blue, and orange flecks of light."
    "You focus your vision, and see the glowing lights come from the assorted luminescent patterns scattered across the carpet covering the entire floor,
        with matching patterns on the ceiling and walls."
    "You hear a click behind you, right before the bright beam of a flashlight fills the room."
    emily "I haven't been here since I was a kid... It looks just like it did the last day we were here. Not a thing out of place..."
    jump ch2d_008

label ch2d_008:
    "You turn towards Emily, and see a soft, childish smile this time."
    "There is a look of wonder on her face, and you can almost picture a younger Emily, more than five years ago now. Notebook in hand, alternating between the 
        pinball machines and interviewing local tweens on their preferred video game genres, Emily would have been at home here."
    "You can see the nostalgia resting for a moment on her face."

    "Emily's attention focuses back on you."
    emily "Okay [pc.name], you know the old gossip, right? I'm sure you've read some of my older work on the subject."
    "While a small part of you resents Emily's cocksure attitude and assumption that you, practically an adult, would have read articles written and published 
        by a then-middle schooler, you have in fact read all of Emily's work."
    "What else was there to do in this town, anyway? It was decent investigative journalism, all things considered."
    "You know the facts: the owner of the arcade, Shellie Diedeme, disappeared five years ago after leaving a note saying she was taking \"time off\" to travel 
        after the loss of her brother."
    "In the note, she said he died in a car accident in California, and after the funeral she wouldn't be back for a while. Shellie had not come back, and that 
        left the arcade vacant, with ownership still rightfully belonging to her."
    emily "Well, recently Demarcus Dillon has been asking around in court about squatters rights to this building. It sounds like someone is making a move to 
        claim the place, and I want to know why."
    emily "Getting the code to the place was child's play, and with you here as my extra eyes and ears, I want to see for myself who is squatting in 
        the old arcade."
    "As you have been talking, moving past the bathroom and handful of tables, Emily's flashlight has swept across the room. A long line of pinball machines 
        cover the far left wall, then rows and rows of arcade games fill the middle of the building."
    "To your right is prize and concessions counter, with more games beyond it covering the far right wall."
    "Emily has brought you to a door labeled \"Employees Only.\""

    emily "Dad says they sweep this place often, since it has such high traffic nearby and would be a prime target for break-ins."
    emily "Considering there hasn't been a break-in in Cape Bay in recent memory, and the only person that ever comes here is Kyle to check the locks, 
        we should be alone. Let's look around!"

label ch2d_011:
    "Looking around the old arcade, you start to realize what Emily meant by \"something old that was very new\" - the place looked absolutely stopped in time.
        It looked like it had just been closed for the night, rather than shuttered for five years."
    "The only difference being the concessions stand, as someone had been thoughtful enough to remove anything that could expire. That left the stand just a 
        little over halfway fully stocked, with bags of candy and chips hanging down long clip chains from the ceiling."
    "On the far wall you can see the extensive collection of pinball machines, all ready for the next customer to step up and take their rightful place. 
        Everything looks like it has been cared for, except for the small layer of dust coating everything."
    "After looking around, Emily calls you back over to look at the \"Employees Only\" door."
    jump ch2d_012

label ch2d_012:
    "As you look closer at the door, you hear Emily rummaging through her bag again. The door has a keypad just like the one on the back door, but other than 
        that it is plain and unadorned."
    emily "Okay, got it! Step back for a second. Oh, and hold this!"
    "Emily hands you the flashlight as she moves toward the keypad."
    "A second later you hear the BEEP of the lock, and a click as Emily swings the door open on silent hinges."
    "You sweep the room with the flashlight, seeing mostly old brown cardboard boxes full of concession stand supplies, a large standing tool box littered 
        with loose machinery, a door in the far right corner of the room, and on the far wall a row of what looks like utility equipment."

        "Instead of holding it cleanly between your teeth, you get a decent amount of spit on the handle as you hold a mouthful of metal. But now you've committed, 
            so you hold the flashlight awkwardly in your mouth while pulling down the 5lb cardboard box."
